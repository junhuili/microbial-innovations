# Microbial Innovations

### Overview: 

--

#### A. Geological Signals of Innovation

1. Representative Trees 

	- New Tree of Life
	- Silva Living Tree Project
	- Tree must be 

2. Tree Patterns

	- Branch Lengths
	- Bursts: size & distribution

3. Geological Time Events

4. Do "burts" map onto/near reasonable geological time events?

5. Do present-day traits agree with Burst-Geology inferences?

--

#### B. Microbial Innovations

1. Create the new, recalibrated tree

2. Are "bursts" a proxy for functional groups?
